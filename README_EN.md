This web application provides a flexible interface for generating **truly random numbers** using quantum entropy obtained from the [ANU Quantum Random Numbers Server](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/). The application implements multiple generation modes and encryption methods, including a demonstration of post-quantum encryption (PQ) based on the Kyber algorithm and AES-GCM.

## üöÄ Features

- **Generation Modes:**
  - **Limited Range:** Generate numbers within a user-defined range (min‚Äìmax).
  - **Infinite:** Generate one large number with a specified bit-length.
  - **Password:** Generate a random password with selectable complexity.

- **Output Formats:**  
  Supported formats include Decimal, Hex, Binary, and Base64.

- **Password Encryption Methods:**
  - **Direct:** No encryption.
  - **ROT13:** A simple symmetric transformation.
  - **Reversed:** Reverse the string.
  - **AES:** Encryption using AES-CBC with PKCS7 padding.
  - **PQ (Kyber + AES-GCM):** Post-quantum encryption using the Kyber algorithm (via [kyber-py](https://pypi.org/project/kyber-py/)) for key encapsulation and AES-GCM for symmetric encryption.

- **Quantum Entropy:**  
  Quantum random bytes are fetched from the ANU API. If the API is unavailable, the system falls back to `os.urandom`.

- **Randomness Validation:**  
  The system computes entropy, compression ratio (using zlib), and performs a œá¬≤-test to assess data quality.

- **Modern Web Interface:**  
  Built with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and served with [Uvicorn](https://uvicorn.org/), styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and includes data visualization via [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

## üìê Mathematical Foundations

### Shannon Entropy

The entropy is computed using the formula:

```
H = -‚àë( p·µ¢ * log‚ÇÇ(p·µ¢) )
```

where `p·µ¢` is the probability of occurrence for the i-th byte. An entropy close to 8 bits/byte indicates highly random data.

### Compression Ratio

The compression ratio is calculated as:

```
C = (compressed data size) / (original data size)
```

A value close to 1 indicates that the data is poorly compressible, implying high randomness.

### œá¬≤-Test

The œá¬≤-test is applied to check the uniformity of the distribution:

```
œá¬≤ = ‚àë( (O·µ¢ - E)¬≤ / E )
```

where `O·µ¢` is the observed count and `E` is the expected count under a uniform distribution. A result close to the tabulated value for a given degree of freedom suggests a uniform distribution.

## üîí Quantum and Post-Quantum Technologies

- **Quantum Entropy:**  
  Utilized to generate truly random numbers based on quantum processes.

- **Post-Quantum Encryption:**  
  The PQ mode demonstrates a hybrid encryption scheme where Kyber (via kyber-py) is used for key encapsulation, and the shared secret is processed via SHA256 to derive a symmetric key used by AES-GCM. This approach enhances the system's resilience against quantum attacks.

- **Future Extensions:**  
  In the future, quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum-resistant protocols could be integrated for secure key exchange.
